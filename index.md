# Gloomhaven Crib Sheet 

1-4 players (3 best) 
Play time (after setup): 30 minutes per player per scenario 

## Setting 

The game treats the city (town?) of Gloomhaven as its base. You can return to it between scenarios, and you can purchase items there. 

To level up, you must visit Gloomhaven.  

Gloomhaven also levels up or "gains prosperity" over time. Leveling up Gloomhaven means more items are for sale there.   

## Scenarios 

The game consists of 95 scenarios, some of which are linked.  

## Staring a Campaign 

1. Select your characters and form your party. 
2. Gather your character materials (mat, sheet, ability cards, and tokens from the tuck box, plus item cards and 1 personal quest card). Note that you start with 30 gold pieces, which you can use to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven.  

## Your Party 

Player chooses from 6 characters at the beginning of the game (there are 17 characters overall): 

* Inox Brute
* Human Scoundrel
* Vermling Mindthief 
* Savvas Cragheart 
* Quatryl Tinkerer 
* Orchid Spellweaver 

For each character, you'll need these items (all in the character tuck boxes): 

* Character mat (two-sided)
* Character sheet (you write on this)
* Character ability cards (each with two actions, top + bottom)

All characters start at Level 1, with 0 experience points (XP) and 30 gold pieces. 

Your party also has a party sheet, which can write on. It helps you keep your "reputation score," among other things. 

## Your Items 

At the beginning of a campaign, you can use your 30 gold pieces to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. 

Each item has a dedicated card. There are 253 item cards in total. Items include armor and potions.  

## Your Quest 

New characters also start with a personal quest. You draw two personal quest cards, and you select one. There are 24 personal quest cards in total.  

The personal quest is your character's primary goal in the campaign, meaning the game is at once cooperative and selfish.
