# Gloomhaven Crib Sheet 

1-4 players cooperative (3 players is ostensibly best)    
Play time (after setup): 30 minutes per player per scenario

## Setting 

The game treats the town of Gloomhaven as its base. You can return to it between scenarios, and you can purchase and sell items there. 

To level up, you must visit Gloomhaven. Leveling up means you gain more hit points, ability cards, and [perks](#perks). Perks affect your [attack modifier](#attacks-in-scenarios) deck.

Gloomhaven also levels up or "gains prosperity" over time. Leveling up the town of Gloomhaven means more items are for sale there. Prosperity is tracked on the bottom of the campaign board. The campaign board is the thing that looks like a map. 

When you visit Gloomhaven, you can play a city event card, which will provide you with choices. There are 81 city event cards in total. The outcomes are usually good when compared with [road cards](#scenarios).   

## Scenarios 

The game consists of 95 scenarios, some of which are linked (you don't need to return to Gloomhaven or travel on the road between linked scenarios). You track your progress through the game by applying stickers to the campaign board (again, the thing that looks like a map). 

A scenario consists of rounds and proceeds until the group either succeeds or fails. Some scenarios limit the number of rounds required to succeed. Track that number using the top row of numbers on the element infusion table (this table is the piece of cardboard with three columns and the numbers 1-12 at the top). 

The scenario book provides maps for how to set up each scenario and its play area. It also provides stories, requirements, goals, achievements, and components (monsters, overlays, traps, and treasure). Global achievements from scenarios are tracked by applying stickers to the top of the campaign board.  

## Starting a Campaign 

1. Select your characters and form [your party](#your-party). Name them all and write the names down on the party and character sheets. Then draw 2 personal quest cards for each character and select 1 card. The quest cards give you a sense of how and when you'd retire your current character and create a new one.   
2. Gather your character materials (for each player): mat, sheet, class 1 ability cards, and 5 character tokens from each character's tuck box, plus item cards, 1 battle goal card, 1 [personal quest](#your-personal-quest) card, 1 player reference card, and a health and experience tracker. The health and experience tracker is the thing with 2 dials; you need 1 per player. Note that each character starts with different HP (between 6 and 10), but all begin with 0 XP. As for battle goal cards, you draw 2, pick 1, and keep it a secret. There are 24 battle goal cards in total. 
3. Buy items in Gloomhaven. Since you start with 30 gold pieces, you can now use that money to buy [items](#your-items) 1-14. 
4. Compile your attack modifier deck (1 for each player). The standard deck consists of 20 cards: +0 (6x), +1 (5x), -1 (5x), +2 (1x), -2 (1x), 2x (1x), and null (1x). Place the attack modifier deck near your character mat. 
5. Near your character materials (say, at the end of the table), place damage tokens (46 in total), money tokens (50 in total, including 1s and 5s), and status condition tokens (60 in total), together with the element infusion table (1 for the party). Then place all six element tokens in the "inert" column of the element infusion table. All of these apply to the entire party. Except for character tokens (see step #2 above), you don't need specific tokens or tables for each player.  
6. Select the scenario for your party and set up the play area in the middle of the table (with the character materials, including the mats, around it). Include monster standees, map tiles, and [overlay tiles](#overlay-tiles) for the first room (and only the first room) on the map. (Your party doesn't have a bird's eye view of the dungeon.) There are 236 monster standees, 30 two-sided map tiles, and 155 two-sided overlay tiles in total. Place your party's characters on the map, too (see the white icons with black arrows and rectangles). Don't forget to include door tiles (overlays) where applicable. When selecting enemies, look in the top left for two-player placement, top right for three-player placement, and bottom for four-player placement. Black means no monster placement; white means normal monster placement; gold means elite monster placement. Use the appropriate stands for normal (white) and elite (yellow/gold). For now, ignore the numbers on the monster standees (meaning you should choose your standees at random). 
7. Determine the difficulty level of your scenario. The default setting (normal) is 1. The difficulty level affects monster levels, gold conversion, trap damage, and bonus experience. The higher the difficulty, the more the rewards. 
8. Gather all the monster ability cards and monster stat cards for all monsters in your scenario. (There are 232 monster ability cards and 47 monster stat cards in total.) Put the stat cards in the sleeves provided. Be sure to use the sleeve to adjust your monster stat cards to correspond with your scenario's difficulty level. 
9. Compile an attack modifier deck for the monsters, too. 1 deck for all monsters (not 1 deck per monster class).
10. Begin your [rounds](#rounds-in-scenarios). Each round consists of first determining (you + other players) whether to select 2 character ability cards or to rest, then determining initiative (you + other players + monsters), then taking turns (you + other players + monsters), and finally cleaning up.    
11. Repeat rounds until you've failed or succeeded to meet the goal of the scenario.  

## Your Party 

At the beginning of the game, you can choose from 6 characters (there are 17 character mats and 18 character miniatures in total): 

* Inox Brute
* Human Scoundrel
* Vermling Mindthief 
* Savvas Cragheart 
* Quatryl Tinkerer 
* Orchid Spellweaver 

See Isaac Childres's [quick descriptions](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23760571#23760571) of the starting characters. 

For each character, you'll need these items (all in the character tuck boxes): 

* Character mat (two-sided)
* Character sheet (you write on this)
* Character ability cards (each with 2 actions, top + bottom; you can only use class 1 and X ability cards at the beginning)
* Character tokens (five per character)

All characters start at Level 1, with 0 experience points (XP) and 30 gold pieces. 

There are 504 character ability cards in total.  

Your party also has a party sheet, which can write on. It helps you to track your reputation score, among other things. Reputation of your party affects the price of items in shops. It is shaped by your responses to various cards and scenarios in the game.  

## Your Items 

At the beginning of a campaign, you can use your 30 gold pieces to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. 

Each item has a dedicated card. There are 253 item cards in total. Items include armor and potions. 

There are three types of items: 

* Permanent effect (e.g., helmets)
* Single use (once per scenario) (X icon)
* Recovered during rest (multiple uses per scenario) (downward red arrow icon)

Some character ability cards allow you to use your items.  

When purchasing first items at the beginning of a campaign, the following are recommended: 

* Brute: boots of striding (001) + minor healing potion (012)
* Tinkering: eagle-eye goggles (006)
* Spellweaver: invisibility cloak (005) + minor power potion (014)
* Scoundrel: leather armor (004) + minor stamina potion (013)
* Mindthief: poison dagger (011) + minor stamina potion (013)
* Cragheart: boots of striding (001) + minor power potion (014)

## Your Personal Quest 

New characters also start with a personal quest. You draw 2 personal quest cards, and you select 1. There are 24 personal quest cards in total.  

The personal quest is your character's primary goal in the campaign, meaning the game is at once cooperative and kinda selfish.

## Rounds in Scenarios

Scenarios consist of rounds. Each round consists of these actions:  

* Determining (you + other players) whether to select 2 player ability cards (placed face down in front of you) or take a [rest](#rests-in-scenarios) (this is a moment where strategy asserts itself; the selection of cards can be very important)
* Determining initiative (you + other players + monsters): play your leading character ability card (the top card of 2) and all relevant monster ability cards (for all monster classes in the room of the dungeon you're in); the initiative number (middle of your character ability card) determines the order of operations (where 1 is the highest number); monster ability cards and their initiative numbers are included in this ranking; the order of operations will likely shape which actions you perform and when (meaning you'll probably change your mind + strategy as play proceeds)
* Character turn: perform the top action of 1 of your character ability cards and the bottom action of your other character ability card (you're free to choose here; the leading or top card is irrelevant at this point in the round); instead of performing these actions, you can perform an [attack](#attacks-in-scenarios) of 2 (top) or a [move](#movement-in-scenarios) of 2 (bottom); once you perform your actions (with attack modifier cards, where applicable), discard your character ability cards (to left of your mat) or, if a character ability card contains an X in the top or bottom you used, then place it in the "lost" pile (to the right of your mat); if your actions have lasting effects (meaning they are repeated during future actions), then place them above your mat (place character tokens on the ability cards to help you to track their uses and repeated effects) 
* Monster turn: focus on a target (closest to the monster), perform the action on the monster ability card (in combination with a monster stat card and attack modifier card), and then apply damage 
* Clean up: perform a short rest, acquire any gold on your hex

The character mats provide a visual synopsis of the actions in each round.  

At the start of the round, when you select your 2 ability cards, you're not supposed to tell people what exactly you plan to do. You're also not supposed to tell people which battle goal card you have.  

If you don't have 2 cards in your hand at the start of a round, and you're unable to rest, then your character is exhausted, removed from the board, and takes no further part in the scenario. (ツ)

## Movement in Scenarios 

Move X (where X is a number of hexes on the board) is the movement action on your character ability cards.  

You can move through allies but cannot end your character in the same space as them. 

You cannot move through enemies, unless your movement involves jumping or flying.  

If you move onto a space with a door, then the door opens, and the next room is revealed. Opening a door does not cost movement points. Once you enter a new room, you should place all of that room's components onto the board and also draw any new relevant monster ability cards. If you enter a room, and monster ability cards for monsters in that room have higher initiative numbers (where the highest initiative number is 1) than the one on your moving character's ability card, then those monsters act immediately. All to say, whatever is on the other side of a door takes a turn (in the round at hand) once you open that door.  

## Attacks in Scenarios 

There are two types of attacks: range and melee.  

Attack X (where X is HP damage done to targets) is the attack action on your character ability cards.  

Unless it is accompanied by range on your character ability card, the attack action assumes your target is adjacent to you. Range X (where X is a number of hexes on the board) is the range variant on your character ability cards. Only walls can block your line of sight (LoS). For range area attacks, you only need range for one of the applicable hexes (not all applicable hexes) to perform the attack. 

LoS: if you can draw a line from a corner of your hex to a corner of the target hex without hitting walls or "dark spaces," then you have line of sight. Opened doors are tricky. Use your best judgment when determining LoS for those.     

Attack values can be modified by: 

* Attack modifier cards
* Other ability cards 
* Item cards
* The target's defensive abilities (see the monster stat cards for shields, e.g.)  

Every time you attack, you must also draw 1 attack modifier card from your attack modifier deck. Null modifier cards mean your attack does no damage. Most common modifiers are +0, +1, and -1. If your attack modifier card has a "shuffle" icon in the bottom right, then your attack modifier deck is shuffled at the end of the round. There are 457 attack modifier cards in total.  

If you have "disadvantage" on your attack, you draw 2 attack modifier cards (instead of 1) and select the worse of the two.  

If you have "advantage" on your attack, then you draw 2 attack modifier cards (instead of 1) and select the better of the two. 

Effects: some character ability cards have other effects: bless, curses, disarm, immobilize, wound, muddle, poison, push, pull, pierce, add target, invisibility, stun, and strengthen. Use your player reference card to follow directions for these. 

Elements: some character ability cards contain element icons, but the character infusion table is confusing. You don't really need to use it or its elements in the game.  

Experience points: some character ability cards provide you with experience points (XP) in addition to movement and attack actions. The experience points appear in a star icon below the actions (top or bottom of the card). Use your health and experience tracker to . . . track . . . XP. If you hit 10 on your XP tracker, then place a 10-point token next to it and return to 0. You also use your character sheet to track XP across scenarios.

Gold: each time a monster is defeated, it drops gold. The amount of gold is based on the difficulty level of the scenario. Use the conversion table in the rule book to convert difficulty level into gold. To collect gold, move to the hex where it's located or loot the area. (Loot is an action provided by some character ability cards.) You can use gold to buy items in Gloomhaven.    

Steps for attack: 

* Look at other cards on the table, including and especially the [monster ability cards](#monster-turns) (available after you determine initiative in step 2 of the round). 
* Select your attack actions from your character ability card (top or bottom of the card).
* Select an attack modifier card and apply it to your attack value. 
* Apply any effects associated with your attack (see your character ability card for the effect and player reference card to apply). 
* Move your character on the board (if applicable); your character attacks if it's adjacent to the target or it's using a range attack.
* Check the monster's stat card (any defense?) and modify the attack value accordingly.
* Check the monster standee's number and then place damage tokens on that number on the monster stat card sleeve. 
* Also place any applicable status tokens (next to damage tokens) on the sleeve. 
* If you defeat a monster, then it drops gold. (See the conversion table; difficulty level determines the conversion.)
* Collect any gold in your hex. 
* If it's an area attack, repeat these steps for all applicable targets. (You draw an attack modifier card per monster, not for the entire group of monsters.)

## Monster Turns 

Monsters move in ascending order (from 1 up) according to the numbers on the monster standees. Elite monsters go first (in ascending order), followed by normal monsters (in ascending order). 

Monsters focus on the characters they can reach with the fewest moves (the lowest number of hexes). When it's a tie (same number of hexes shared by two or more characters), then the monsters focus on the character with the highest initiative number (where 1 is the highest). 

Use the monster ability cards in combination with the monster stat sheets and attack modifier cards to determine a given monster's moves and attacks. Elite (gold) and normal (white) monsters have different abilities and thus different numerical values associated with their actions. 

Not all monster ability cards involve both attack and movement. 

Damage: You can apply damage to your character in 1 of 2 ways: 

* Reduce the HP on your health and experience tracker, or 
* Move 2 character ability cards from your discard pile to your lost pile, or 
* Move 1 character ability card from your hand to your lost pile.  

Steps for monster attacks: 
* Determine the monster's focus. 
* Draw monster ability card. 
* Check monster's stat card with the drawn monster ability card. Determine the attack value.  
* Draw an attack modifier card and change the attack value accordingly. 
* Apply the damage.  
* If your monster ability card has a "shuffle" icon in the bottom right, then your monster ability deck is shuffled at the end of the round.

## Rests in Scenarios 

Resting allows you to return character ability cards from your discard pile into your hand, rendering them active again.  

There are two types of rest: short and long. To perform either, you need at least two character ability cards in your discard pile.  

Short rest: you can perform a short rest at the end of any round. Shuffle all the cards in your discard pile and pick one at random. That card is lost; the others return to your hand. If you're unhappy that you lost a particular card, you can suffer 1 HP of damage and instead lose a different random card.  

Long rest: you must declare this action at the start of a round. You don't play two character ability cards. Instead, you select (purposefully, not randomly) a character ability card from your discard pile and move it to the lost pile. The rest of the discard pile returns to your hand. You also recover 2 HP and recover any sideways [items](#items).

If you don't have two character ability cards in your hand at the start of a round, then you must declare a long rest. If you don't have two character ability cards in your discard pile, then you are unable to rest and are exhausted (out of the scenario).

## Summoning 

Character and monster ability cards allow new characters or monsters to be summoned into a scenario. A summoned character or monster is represented by a large summon token and placed in a hex adjacent to the summoner. If multiple characters or monsters are summoned, use the small summon tokens to track them on character or monster ability cards.  

Summoned characters or monsters do not take a turn in the round in which they're summoned. They take their turns immediately before the character who summoned them. They follow the same roles as monster moves and attacks. See the card that summoned them for their details.  

## Overlay Tiles 

Each scenario contains overlay tiles: 

* Obstacles: block movement, but can be jumped or flown over; they do not block LoS
* Traps: deals damage to characters and monsters according to the difficulty level of the scenario; does not block LoS and can be jumped or flown over; monsters will avoid it if possible (focusing instead on characters not near traps); it's removed after it's triggered

## Perks 

One perk per every three check marks is gained by characters. Check marks are acquired when meeting battle goals at the end of a scenario. 

Record check marks and perks on your character sheet.   

## Scenario Failure 

A scenario fails if all players become exhausted or the scenario goal is not met.

Exhaustion happens when you either hit 0 HP or don't have two character ability cards in your hand or discard pile.   

When you fail a scenario, you still keep all XP and gold collected.    

## Traveling between Scenarios 

Unless scenarios are linked, you need to draw a road event card to travel from place to place (or scenario to scenario) on the campaign board. There are 69 road event cards in total; they present you with choices. Once you select a choice, you flip over the card to see the results of your decision. Road cards are either placed back in the deck or discarded altogether after they are played. (See the icon in the bottom right of results to determine whether to place it back in the deck or discard it.) 

## Personal Quest 

Once you complete the personal quest listed on your personal quest card, you must return to Gloomhaven and retire your character. You then select a new character, unlock new game content, open the town records book (small booklet), and increase the town's prosperity.  

## New Characters 

When you create a new character, it enters the game at the prosperity level of Gloomhaven (not level 1).
