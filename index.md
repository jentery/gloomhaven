# Gloomhaven Crib Sheet 

1-4 players (3 best) 
Play time (after setup): 30 minutes per player per scenario 

## Setting 

The game treats the city (town?) of Gloomhaven as its base. You can return to it between scenarios, and you can purchase and sell items there. 

To level up, you must visit Gloomhaven. Leveling up means you gain more hit points, ability cards, and "perks." Perks affect your "attack modifier" deck. (See below.)  

Gloomhaven also levels up or "gains prosperity" over time. Leveling up Gloomhaven means more items are for sale there. Prosperity is tracked on the campaign board (bottom).  

When you visit Gloomhaven, you can play a city card, which will provide you with choices. The outcomes are usually good (compare with road cards, see below).  

## Scenarios 

The game consists of 95 scenarios, some of which are linked. You can track your progress through the game using the campaign board, which is mostly a map. A scenario consists of rounds and proceeds until the group either succeeds or fails. Some scenarios limit the number of rounds required to succeed. Track that number using the "element infusion table." 

The scenario book provides maps for how to set up each scenario. It also provides stories, requirements, goals, achievements, and components (monsters, overlays, traps, treasure). Global achievements from scenarios are tracked on the campaign board (top).  

## Staring a Campaign 

1. Select your characters and form your party. Name them. 
2. Gather your character materials (mat, sheet, class 1 ability cards, and 5 tokens from the tuck box, plus item cards, 1 battle goal card, 1 personal quest card, and a health and experience tracker). Note that you start with 30 gold pieces, which you can use to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. Also note that each character starts with different HP (between 6 and 10), but all begin with 0 XP. As for battle goal cards, you draw two and pick one.  
3. Compile your attack modifier deck. The standard deck consists of 20 cards: +0 (6x), +1 (5x), -1 (5x), +2 (1x), -2 (1x), 2x (1x), and null (1x). Place it near your character mat. 
4. Near your character materials (near, say, the end of the table), place damage tokens, money tokens, and condition tokens, together with the element infusion table. Then place all element tokens in the "inert" column of the element infusion table.    
5. Select your scenario and set up the play area in the middle of the table (with the character materials around it). Include monster standees, traps, and overlays for the first room on the map. Place your party's characters on the map, too (see the white icons with black arrows and rectangles). Don't forget to include door tiles (overlays) where applicable. When selecting enemies, look in the top left for two-player placement, top right for three-player placement, and bottom for four-player placement. Black means no monster placement; white means normal monster placement; gold means elite monster placement. Use the appropriate stands for normal (white) and elite (gold). Ignore the numbers on the monster standees (meaning you should choose them at random).  
6. Gather all the monster ability cards and monster stat cards for all monsters in your scenario. Put the stat cards in the sleeves provided.  
7. Compile an attack modifier deck for the monsters, too. One deck for all monsters (not one each).
8. Determine the difficulty level of your scenario. The default setting (normal) is 1. The difficulty level affects monster levels, gold conversion, trap damage, and bonus experience. Be sure to adjust your monster stat cards (using the sleeve) to correspond with your difficulty level.  
9. 


## Your Party 

Player chooses from 6 characters at the beginning of the game (there are 17 characters overall): 

* Inox Brute
* Human Scoundrel
* Vermling Mindthief 
* Savvas Cragheart 
* Quatryl Tinkerer 
* Orchid Spellweaver 

For each character, you'll need these items (all in the character tuck boxes): 

* Character mat (two-sided)
* Character sheet (you write on this)
* Character ability cards (each with two actions, top + bottom; you can only use class 1 and X ability cards at the beginning)

All characters start at Level 1, with 0 experience points (XP) and 30 gold pieces. 

Your party also has a party sheet, which can write on. It helps you track your "reputation score," among other things. Reputation of your party affects the price of items in shops.  

## Your Items 

At the beginning of a campaign, you can use your 30 gold pieces to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. 

Each item has a dedicated card. There are 253 item cards in total. Items include armor and potions.  

## Your Quest 

New characters also start with a personal quest. You draw two personal quest cards, and you select one. There are 24 personal quest cards in total.  

The personal quest is your character's primary goal in the campaign, meaning the game is at once cooperative and selfish.

## Rounds

Scenarios consist of rounds. Each round consists of these actions:  

* Start of round: decide whether you'll select 2 character ability cards (placed face down in front of you) or take a "long rest" 
* Initiative: play your "leading card" and your monster ability card; the initiative number (middle of your character ability card) determines the order of operations (lowest number goes first); monster ability cards and their initiative numbers are included in this ranking
* Character turn: perform the top action of one of your character ability cards and the bottom action of your other character ability card; instead of performing these actions, you can perform an attack of 2 (top) or a move of 2 (bottom); once you perform your actions, discard your character ability cards (discard pile to left of your mat) or, if it contains an X in the top or bottom you used, then it's "lost" (lost pile to the right of your mat); if your actions have lasting effects (meaning they are repeated during future actions), then place them above your mat  
* Monster turn: 
* Clean up 

The character mats provide a visual synopsis of the actions in each round.  

At the start of the round, when you select your 2 ability cards, you're not supposed to tell people what exactly you plan to do. 


## Traveling 

Unless scenarios are linked, you need to draw a road card to travel from place to place (or scenario to scenario) on the campaign board. Road cards present you with choices. Once you decide, you flip over the card to see the results of your decision. Road cards are either placed back in the deck or discarded altogether after they are played. (See the icon in the bottom right of results to determine whether to shuffle it back into the deck or discard it.) 

## Personal Quest 

Once you complete the personal quest listed on your personal quest card, you must return to Gloomhaven and retire your character. You then select a new character, unlock new game content, open the town records book, and increase the town's prosperity.  

## New Characters 

When you create a new character, it enters the game at the prosperity level of Gloomhaven (not level 1).
