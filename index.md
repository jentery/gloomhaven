# Gloomhaven Crib Sheet 

1-4 players (3 best) 
Play time (after setup): 30 minutes per player per scenario 

## Setting 

The game treats the city (town?) of Gloomhaven as its base. You can return to it between scenarios, and you can purchase and sell items there. 

To level up, you must visit Gloomhaven. Leveling up means you gain more hit points, ability cards, and "perks." Perks affect your "attack modifier" deck. (See below.)  

Gloomhaven also levels up or "gains prosperity" over time. Leveling up Gloomhaven means more items are for sale there. Prosperity is tracked on the campaign board (bottom).  

When you visit Gloomhaven, you can play a city card, which will provide you with choices. The outcomes are usually good (compare with road cards, see below).  

## Scenarios 

The game consists of 95 scenarios, some of which are linked. You can track your progress through the game using the campaign board, which is mostly a map.  

The scenario book provides maps for how to set up each scenario. It also provides stories, requirements, goals, achievements, and components (monsters, overlays, traps, treasure). Global achievements from scenarios are tracked on the campaign board (top).  

## Staring a Campaign 

1. Select your characters and form your party. 
2. Gather your character materials (mat, sheet, class 1 ability cards, and 5 tokens from the tuck box, plus item cards, 1 battle goal card, 1 personal quest card, and a health and experience tracker). Note that you start with 30 gold pieces, which you can use to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. 
3. Compile your attack modifier deck. The standard deck consists of 20 cards: +0 (6x), +1 (5x), -1 (5x), +2 (1x), -2 (1x), 2x (1x), and null (1x).  
4. Select your scenario and set it up. Include monster standees, traps, and overlays for the first room on the map. Place your characters on the map, too.  
5. Gather all the monster ability cards and monster stat cards for all monsters in your scenario. You put the stat cards in the sleeves provided.  
6. Compile an attack modifier deck for the monsters, too. One deck for all monsters (not one each).  

## Your Party 

Player chooses from 6 characters at the beginning of the game (there are 17 characters overall): 

* Inox Brute
* Human Scoundrel
* Vermling Mindthief 
* Savvas Cragheart 
* Quatryl Tinkerer 
* Orchid Spellweaver 

For each character, you'll need these items (all in the character tuck boxes): 

* Character mat (two-sided)
* Character sheet (you write on this)
* Character ability cards (each with two actions, top + bottom; you can only use class 1 and X ability cards at the beginning)

All characters start at Level 1, with 0 experience points (XP) and 30 gold pieces. 

Your party also has a party sheet, which can write on. It helps you track your "reputation score," among other things. Reputation of your party affects the price of items in shops.  

## Your Items 

At the beginning of a campaign, you can use your 30 gold pieces to buy items 1-14 from Gloomhaven. 

Each item has a dedicated card. There are 253 item cards in total. Items include armor and potions.  

## Your Quest 

New characters also start with a personal quest. You draw two personal quest cards, and you select one. There are 24 personal quest cards in total.  

The personal quest is your character's primary goal in the campaign, meaning the game is at once cooperative and selfish.

## Traveling 

Unless scenarios are linked, you need to draw a road card to travel from place to place (or scenario to scenario) on the campaign board. Road cards present you with choices. Once you decide, you flip over the card to see the results of your decision. Road cards are either placed back in the deck or discarded altogether after they are played. (See the icon in the bottom right of results to determine whether to shuffle it back into the deck or discard it.) 

## Personal Quest 

Once you complete the personal quest listed on your personal quest card, you must return to Gloomhaven and retire your character. You then select a new character, unlock new game content, open the town records book, and increase the town's prosperity.  

## New Characters 

When you create a new character, it enters the game at the prosperity level of Gloomhaven (not level 1).
